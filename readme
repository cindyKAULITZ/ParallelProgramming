read train and test datasets

split train dataset into train and validation
use KNN on train - return classification matrix (posterior distribution for each class)
use KNN on valid - choose the best K

Calculate:

1) Success rate, rejection rate for different K
2) Confusion Matrix
3) Top X success rate



KNN Results: matrix of Nexamples X K, with the probability of example X being assigned to class K
